# Dartmouth-Map-Navigator

This project was my final project for my first CS course, in which I 
constructed a shortest-path-finder for a map of Dartmouth College.

To do this, I compiled together a list of all the key locations at
Dartmouth College, from the dining halls to the dorm rooms to the famous
Baker-Berry library tower. I then implemented a BFS algorithm that takes
in a vertex value A, and builds a dictionary from that vertex to any other
vertex across the map (over which the mouse hovers).

In it, you will find 4 files, each one's purpose described at the top
of the file.
